Software Development Plan

Statement of Purpose and Scope
This app is designed to help users who are at a desk most of the day (such as students and educators using online platforms) increase their water consumption throughout the day in a fun way, as many prefer caffeinated drinks or fail to move away from their desk. Dehydration has negative impacts on most systems in the body and may even impact productivity, so increasing water consumption is in everyone’s best interest!

Once installed (please see the help file), the user will interact with the app via text input through terminal:
-    The app will output a greeting and request their name.
-    The user will input their name which will be stored.
-    Using their name, the app will output the premise; the more water you drink, the more points you get.
-    The app will output asking the user to play (input “yes” progresses, “no” quits”).
-    The app will output a brief explanation of points (e.g. water is worth the most points, caffeine lowers in points as the day progresses, alcohol is only worth minimal points in the evening), 
-    The app will output how many points the average adult should aim for and ask them to set a goal.
-    The user will input an integer to indicate amount of cups. If this input is incorrect (i.e. a string or float), the app will output a prompt on correct format and ask for input again. When correct input is received the app will output a confirmation message. 
-    The app will output asking what time it is (user to input), store it and manage incorrect input as per the previous step. 
-    The app will output asking the user how much of a type drink they have had today and store that information. This will repeat for water, tea/coffee, soda/other sweet drinks, alcohol, juice and other drinks. Incorrect input will be managed as per previous steps.
-    The app will calculate the user’s point total based on internal points systems and output their score. The app will compare their score to their goal and output an appropriate message.
